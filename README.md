# Section Connection  
A new social tool that college students can use to connect with other students that are taking the same
course but may reside in a different section with a different teacher. This tool helps students connect 
with one another and allows for multiple professor's teachings to reach students that would never have
had the opportunity to be taught their way.

# Installation  
The project is built with react, and postgresSQL.  
npm install - must be run in the terminal to initialize the project  
npm start - will launch the javascript into a local browser window

From there the functionality of the website will be accessible. The user will be able to enter their
name and then access the different course chats that are available.

To utilize the postgres database one must import the dump.sql file into their postgres to initialize the
proper tables that the application uses from it. Once the tables and database are properly initialized
the chat messages are saved to the database and students are able to communicate with each other and have
their messages saved.

# My contribution
This was a group project that was worked on with 3 other people. My role in the project was creating the 
react front end display, creating the database structure, and connecting the front and back end.
Through completing this project I learned new skills in javascript, css, and postgresSQL. It was 
a great opportunity for me to learn by doing and after its completion I have the skills to build other 
full stack applications.
